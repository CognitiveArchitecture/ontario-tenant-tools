## Not Legal Advice

Ontario Tenant Tools provides **general legal information** about tenant rights in Ontario, Canada. This information is educational and intended to help you understand your rights and the legal process.

**This is NOT legal advice.**

Legal advice is specific guidance about your particular situation from a qualified professional. This website cannot:

- Tell you what you should do
- Predict the outcome of your case
- Represent you at the Landlord and Tenant Board
- Create a lawyer-client relationship

## Limitations

### Information May Be Incomplete

Housing law is complex. These tools cover common situations but cannot address every circumstance. Your situation may involve factors not covered here.

### Information May Change

Laws and regulations change. While we strive to keep information current:

- Bill 60 (2025) amended many rules recently
- Some regulations are still pending
- LTB procedures may be updated
- Always verify critical deadlines with official sources

### Calculations Are Estimates

The calculators provide estimates based on information you enter. Errors in your inputs will produce incorrect results. The Landlord and Tenant Board may calculate differently.
