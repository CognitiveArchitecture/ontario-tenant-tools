# Privacy Policy

**Ontario Tenant Tools** is designed with a zero-data-collection posture.

---

## Data Collection

**We collect no data.**

- All calculations happen entirely in your browser
- No data is sent to any server
- No user accounts or registration
- No analytics or tracking scripts
- No cookies beyond PWA service worker functionality

---

## Local Storage

The app uses browser local storage only for:

- **Theme preferences** (light mode, high contrast settings)
- **PWA caching** (offline functionality via service worker)

This data never leaves your device.

---

## Session Data

Calculator results are stored temporarily in browser memory during your session for the Report feature. This data:

- Is never transmitted anywhere
- Is cleared when you close the browser tab
- Is immediately cleared when you use the **Quick Exit** button

---

## Quick Exit

The Quick Exit button on every page:

1. Immediately navigates away from this site
2. Clears all session data
3. Clears browser history entry (where supported)

This feature is designed for users in unsafe situations who need to leave quickly without trace.

---

## Third-Party Services

**Hosting:** This app is hosted on Netlify as a static site. Netlify may collect standard server logs (IP addresses, timestamps) as part of normal web hosting. We have not enabled any Netlify analytics features.

**No other third-party services** are used. No:

- Analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Tracking pixels
- Social media integrations
- Advertising networks
- User behavior monitoring

---

## External Links

This app contains links to official government and legal resources (ontario.ca, tribunalsontario.ca, legalaid.on.ca, etc.). When you click these links, you leave this app and are subject to those sites' privacy policies.

---

## Content Security Policy

This app enforces a strict Content Security Policy that blocks all external network connections (`connect-src: 'none'`). This means:

- No data can be sent to external servers via JavaScript
- No external resources are loaded
- The app works entirely offline once cached

---

## Children's Privacy

This app is designed for adult users dealing with tenancy matters. We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update this document and note the change in CHANGELOG.md.
