# ontario-tenant-tools — AI Collaboration

## Context
Open source repository providing tenant rights tools for Ontario. Targets GitHub publication under Apache 2.0.

## Critical Constraints
1. **No legal advice** — This is information, not counsel
2. **Plain language** — Grade 5 reading level mandatory
3. **Accessibility** — Every change must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA
4. **Privacy** — Zero data collection, no exceptions

## Working Here
- Refer to PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md for foundational principles
- Check legal/ for regulatory gaps and pending clarifications
- Bill 60 (Nov 2025) changes are reflected but some details pending

## Collaboration
Help with:
- Code review and optimization
- Accessibility auditing
- Plain language rewrites
- Test coverage
- Documentation improvements

## What NOT to do
- Do not add any form of tracking or analytics
- Do not write content that could be construed as legal advice
- Do not bypass legal review for document generation features
- Do not compromise offline-first capability
